Hello!

I'm learning to code. A couple of weeks ago one of my friends introduced me to the ADA Developer Academy. I intend to apply for the program, and I'm studying my way through the JumpStart curriculum available on their website. The information has been great; I'm enjoying working my way through the lessons, supplementing this education with other guides and tutorials from around the web.

After watching the Ruby coding video by Jeremy in Jump-Start lesson 9, I felt ready to try writing my first program. Thanks Jeremy! Applying basic rules for assigning user-inputed information to variables, I wrote up a short conversation with a computer. Really enjoyed this. I'm saving the program here to look back on later.
